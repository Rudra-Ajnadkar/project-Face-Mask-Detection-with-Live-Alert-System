# project-Face-Mask-Detection-with-Live-Alert-System
This project is a real-time face mask detection system that uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. 


---

##  Abstract

This project addresses the need for monitoring public safety during pandemics by detecting face mask usage in real-time. It uses a CNN-based model trained on a dataset of masked and unmasked faces, combined with OpenCV for face detection and Flask for deployment.

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**


---

##  Steps to Run the Project

1. **Install Requirements**

2. **Train the Model**

3. **Run the Real-Time Detection**




---

##  Features

- Real-time mask detection via webcam
- Visual alert if no mask detected
- Simple web interface using Flask
- Easy to retrain with your own dataset

---

##  Dataset

Dataset contains two categories:
- `with_mask/`: Faces wearing masks
- `without_mask/`: Faces not wearing masks


---

## Conclusion

This Face Mask Detection System can be implemented in real-world scenarios like hospitals, offices, and public places to ensure safety compliance and help mitigate virus spread.
